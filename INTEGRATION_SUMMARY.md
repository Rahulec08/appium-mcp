# MCP-Appium Integration Summary

This document summarizes the steps taken to make MCP-Appium server work with a configuration format similar to Playwright's MCP server.

## Implemented Changes

1. **Created NPX Entry Point**

   - Added `npx-entry.ts` file to handle stdin configuration
   - Built and set executable permissions on the compiled file

2. **Updated Package Configuration**

   - Modified `package.json` to include the new entry point
   - Added bin entry for `mcp-appium` command

3. **Created Example Files**

   - `mcp-config-test.ts` for demonstrating the usage
   - `test-npx-config.ts` for testing the configuration flow
   - `multi-server-test.ts` for showing integration with other MCP servers

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Updated README with information about the new approach
   - Created `NPX_USAGE_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions
   - Added GitHub Copilot integration examples
   - Created sample configuration file

## How It Works

The configuration flow works as follows:

1. User creates a configuration with MCP server definitions:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mcp-appium": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["mcp-appium-visual"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. When the server is started (with `npx mcp-appium-visual`), it:

   - Checks for configuration from stdin
   - Parses and applies the configuration
   - Starts the MCP server with the appropriate settings

3. The client connects to the server using:
   ```javascript
   const transport = new NodeClientTransport({
     command: config.mcpServers["mcp-appium"].command,
     args: config.mcpServers["mcp-appium"].args,
   });
   ```

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run one of the example files:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node examples/mcp-config-test.ts
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Publish to NPM**

   - Update version number
   - Run `npm publish`

2. **Create GitHub Release**

   - Tag the version
   - Add release notes

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Add more examples
   - Create video tutorial
